  **Data Scientist** with expertise in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** | Focused on AI Research Impact | Seeking Data Science or ML Engineering Roles
  Having started coding at an early age which led me gravitate to take CS as my stream and also having completed my Bachelor's, I can say my interest in this filed has only grown with time. I gravitate more towards Data Science and Machine Learning. Working in the technology sector for about 1 year has helped me gain relevant experience in the industry.

  I enjoy using [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org/) to optimize my data science workflow and have noticed it making guest appearances elsewhere in my life.

  As businesses today are becoming more inextricably linked with information technology. I strive to utilise my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business. My key interest lies solely in sharing and discussing my technical expertise with people. I thoroughly enjoy tackling problems pertaining to technology and coming up with novel ideas. I also believe in Kata - the Japanese ideology of thinking before acting which enables me to be able to focus on not only continuous improvement, but also innovation.
